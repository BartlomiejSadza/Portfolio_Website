        <p>Iâ€™m recently gratuated Civil Engineer turned to Computer Science enthusiast. After diving into my first job in civil engineering, I quickly realized it wasnâ€™t the path for me. Thatâ€™s when I shifted my focus to the world of ITâ€”a field that fuels my passion for both problem-solving and creativity.</p>
        <p>When Iâ€™m not deep into coding, youâ€™ll (sometimes ðŸ˜†) find me at the gym, exploring the world of investing, or reading a good book. I love staying curious, constantly learning, and pushing myself to grow. Iâ€™ve also got an interest for cars and I never shy away from a great party! ðŸ’ƒ</p>
        <p>With a knack for leadership, teamwork, and managing risk, I thrive in challenging environments.</p>
